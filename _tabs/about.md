Hi, I’m Jane Kamondo – a passionate tech girl with a love for learning from data and exploring new insights. I’m deeply interested in AI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Data Analysis, and I enjoy turning raw data into meaningful stories.

I’m curious, growth-oriented, and always eager to learn. I see patterns everywhere and love asking “why” to uncover the insights that make technology and data exciting.
